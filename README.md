4. Save the script (File > Save or Ctrl+S).
5. Reload YouTube, and you'll see the "My Playlists" link added to the sidebar.

### Greasy Fork

You can also install the script directly from [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/) for easier updates and installation.

1. Go to the [Greasy Fork page for the script](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/515827-youtube-sidebar-playlists-loader).
2. Click the **Install this script** button.
3. Tampermonkey will automatically prompt you to install the script.

## Usage

1. After installation, visit YouTube.
2. In the sidebar, you’ll notice a new **"My Playlists"** link.
3. Hover over the link, and a submenu will pop up with a list of your playlists.
4. Click on any playlist to open it in a new tab.

## Requirements

- **Browser Extension**: Requires the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension, which is available on most modern browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- **Supported Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and any browser compatible with the Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey extension.
- **ECMAScript Version**: The script is written in ECMAScript 2020+ (ES11) and uses features like optional chaining for modern browser support.

## How It Works

The script uses YouTube’s internal API to fetch and load your playlists into a dynamic submenu that appears when you hover over the "My Playlists" link in the sidebar. This avoids overloading the page by only displaying the playlists when needed.
